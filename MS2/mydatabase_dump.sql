A 4-year groundbreaking initiative to refine, test, and scale innovative renewable energy solutions that enable 5,000 fish producers, processors, and other fish value chain actors in Egypt to increase their productivity and incomes, leading to improved food and nutrition security, reduced food waste and loss, and more energy-efficient and climate-smart food value chains.Center for Renewable Energy in Aquaculture (CeREA) key interventions seek to:Refine, test, and scale innovative renewable energy solutions that enable fish value chain actors in Egypt to increase their productivity and income leading to improved food and nutrition security, reduced food waste and loss, and more adaptation to energy-efficient and climate-smart systems.Deployment of appropriate renewable energy technologies for aquaculture, along with efficient planning ad capacity building for scaling the Egyptian aquaculture sector in a sustainable, climate-friendly and inclusive manner to support both economic growth and protein needs of the country’s rapidly expanding population.Consultancy objectives:Development of a gender-sensitive assessment tool which has to consider intersectionality through integrating socio-economic inclusion across multiple dimensions of the Egyptian aquaculture value chainIdentify critical factors that limit women and youth participation, engagement and highlighting viable pathways to ensure that (CeREA)’s selected innovations for piloting and scaling are strongly integrating gender and social inclusion across different project outputs.Identify opportunities for women and youth empowerment along the Egyptian aquaculture value chain, with considerations to climate-change constrains.Design of a gender-sensitive and inclusive strategy for (CeREA)’s 4-years strategic implementation.Scope of Consultancy:WorldFish seeks to hire a gender and social inclusion international consultant. S/he is to join another two consultants in designing and developing a baseline study that shall addresses solutions for optimizing renewable energy solutions aimed at tackling key challenges within Egyptian aquaculture value chain.The mentioned-study requires development of key instrumental surveying tools that mainly focus on:Carrying out a gender assessment for analyzing gender and social inclusion gaps, challenges and opportunities using (Micro, Meso and Macro) analyses among other tools (e.g. S.W.O.T analysis).Integrating gender and youth specific approaches to enhance social inclusion dimensions for increasing their participation in (CeREA)’s different activities (e.g. entrepreneurship opportunities for women processors, fish retailers and small-scale farmers).Piloting at least two or three gender transformative approaches (GTAs) in the research cites to determine the best GTA approach that can be scaled to advance the work of promoting the use of climate-smart and renewable energy in the CeREA project.Submission of a preliminary report of key-findings and results that have been carried out under the baseline survey of the study for the gender equality and social inclusion domain of the project.Development of (GESI) strategy, gender-sensitive assessment tool that will be mainstreamed across the project key interventions until 2027 and submission of consultancy final technical report.The consultant is expected to become familiar with project outcomes and outputs through a desk review of project key documents (e.g. logical framework, factsheet, etc.).
